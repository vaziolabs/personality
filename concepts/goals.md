# Goals

## How Humans Create Goals

Goal creation arises from the alignment (or misalignment) of internal and external drivers:

### Perception: The First Step

Humans perceive internal needs (hunger, achievement, security) and external stimuli (cultural norms, opportunities, threats).
These perceptions provide the raw material for recognizing desires and formulating objectives, from short-term survival goals (eating) to long-term ambitions (career mastery).

### Beliefs Shape Goals
Core Beliefs: Fundamental values and self-concepts (e.g., “I am capable” or “I must succeed to be loved”) influence what goals feel achievable or worthwhile.
Learned Beliefs: Experiences refine goal creation. For example, a person who succeeded in a prior challenge is more likely to aim higher.
Conflict of Beliefs: Conflicting beliefs may make goals vague or divided, such as wanting to succeed but fearing failure.

### Desire as the Driving Force

Biological Desire: Drives survival-related goals (e.g., seeking food, shelter).
Psychological Desire: Drives social and emotional goals, like belonging or self-esteem.
Aspirational Desire: Drives complex and future-oriented goals (e.g., becoming an artist), fueled by the desire for growth, mastery, or purpose.
Desire acts as the "spark" for identifying and committing to goals, often triggered by unmet needs or future aspirations.

## The Role of the Conscious System

### Conscious (Explicit Thought):
Goals at this layer are deliberate. For example, "I want to save $5,000 this year" arises from evaluating resources and priorities.

### Subconscious (Implicit Processes):
Goals often emerge from habits and emotional associations, like a subconscious pull to please others or avoid discomfort.
Past experiences anchor current decision-making (e.g., if saving $5,000 is emotionally associated with security, the goal feels natural).

### Unconscious (Primal and Instinctive):
Deep-rooted, often invisible drivers influence goal creation. An unconscious fear of instability may lead to prioritizing financial goals over creative goals, without conscious awareness of why.

## Multi-Sequence Goals

### Short-Term Goals:
Address immediate needs and drive daily behavior (e.g., completing a small coding project).

### Long-Term Goals:
Satisfy aspirational or identity-driven desires (e.g., becoming a software engineer).

### Integration or Coalescence:
Short- and long-term goals interact. Mastery of small projects builds confidence toward greater ambitions, while long-term visions keep short-term efforts focused.
In some cases, disconnect arises between short- and long-term goals, causing inefficiency (e.g., prioritizing minor tasks while neglecting the larger vision).

## Frameworks for Belief-Driven Goals

The underlying human-behavioral system ensures goals are shaped and refined through these frameworks:

### Cognitive Feedback Loops:
Success or failure updates beliefs (e.g., achieving a goal reinforces confidence, while failure adjusts expectations or creates avoidance tendencies).

### Emotional Integration:
Positive emotions tied to desired outcomes (e.g., joy at financial security) make goals compelling, while negative emotions (e.g., fear of rejection) may skew them.

### Environmental Feedback:
Societal or cultural inputs shape belief frameworks and incentivize particular goals (e.g., career success in Western cultures vs. communal harmony in collectivist societies).

## Desire and Its Link to Goal Formation

Desire integrates emotional, biological, and aspirational systems:

Desires amplify motivation to pursue a goal. For example, the psychological desire for independence inspires financial and educational goals.
Conflict occurs when competing desires create competing priorities (e.g., short-term comfort vs. long-term stability).
Desire acts on multiple timelines, driving immediate actions like starting a task and long-term persistence through obstacles.

## Interaction with Impulses and Social Behaviors

Goals feed into impulses and interactions via real-time responses and reflective strategies:

### Impulse Regulation:

Short-term desires, like procrastination, can undermine long-term goals. The ability to balance impulse gratification (subconscious layer) with conscious restraint depends on strong emotional regulation and belief alignment.
Unconscious drives (like stress-eating) may derail goals unless consciously addressed.

### Social Interactions:

Social validation reinforces goals (e.g., praise for achievements strengthens commitment).
Goals are influenced by societal standards; we pursue those deemed socially valuable (e.g., high-income careers).
